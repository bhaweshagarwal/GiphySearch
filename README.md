# GiphySearch
The site I worked on, i.e., [giphysearch.bhaweshagarwal.tech](http://giphysearch.bhaweshagarwal.tech), is live and I would be happy if you could take your valuable time out to review it and share your thoughts. I know this is very basic but it's just a starting point and I have just started to learn the languages.

The website I created is a single-page application (Very Basic) that leverages the [Giphy API for developers](https://giphy.com/). It allows users to search for and retrieve data from Giphy based on their specified search term.

The retrieved data is then displayed on the screen for the users to enjoy. Please take a moment to explore the website and provide your valuable feedback.

Keep in mind that this is a beginner-level project as I am just starting to learn the programming languages involved.
